# Foy'z Tech Revolution
This is a school project to create a scalable digital architecture. I was the manager and client representative for this project. 

The goal is to create an application developed in Dart (Flutter) or Javascript (React Native) to allow students from the school to access their bar account. 
It should be developed according to the website's existing structure (which could be edited if necessary). 

## Goals : 
   -   Develop an application (in Dart or JavaScript, your choice) to support the existing student centre website, adhering to an already pre-developed but still highly modular architecture.
   -   Apply software design principles (from the CSN and SOIA courses in the 2nd year) to make the future structure a modular and scalable solution.
   -   Draw inspiration from artificial intelligence principles to perform data processing, helping clients (in this case, the student centre managers) make informed decisions about the products to offer for sale.
   -   Complete the project using teamwork strategies provided in the project management courses.


## Potential languages used : 
CSS - HTML - JavaScript - SQL - Dart - React Native - Git
